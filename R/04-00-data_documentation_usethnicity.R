#   Data from Youth Risk Behaviour Survey
# }
# \description{
#   This data set contains variables on race and ethnic identification from the 2017 Youth Risk Behaviour Survey, together with two variables on smoking behaviour.  The YRBS is a multistage cluster-sampled survey, so valid inference about associations requires using survey design information. This subset is useful only for demonstration purposes.
